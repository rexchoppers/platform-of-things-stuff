# Overview
Still not found any encryption keys to decode SIA messages from Visonic PowerMaster panels and to be honest, I don't think I will at this rate. However, I've been enjoying using the HomeAssistant Visonic integration alongside a Visonic Proxy

- [HomeAssistant Visonic Integration](https://github.com/davesmeghead/visonic)
- [Visonic Proxy](https://github.com/msp1974/visonic_proxy)

The Visonic proxy uses the PowerLink3 module to communicate with the panel and exposes communications from HA to the panel instead of using the PowerManage server.

During all this though, I've still been reverse engineering the PowerManage/PowerLink API.

# Documentation Updates
- [Visonic Documentation](https://rexchoppers.github.io/visonic-pmaxservice-docs/) - This was originally created with all the methods etc... I've decided to strip both PowerManage + PowerLink API documentation into separate sites for clarity and any other Visonic specific information will remain here.

- [PowerLink API Documentation](https://github.com/rexchoppers/docs-powerlink-api)

- [PowerManage API Documentation](https://github.com/rexchoppers/docs-powermanage-api)

I've also been able to aquire a second-hand Next CAM K9 PG2 camera and document where to locate image + audio streams from the camera.
