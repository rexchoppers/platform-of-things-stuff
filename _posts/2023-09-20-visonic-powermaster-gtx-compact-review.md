# Overview
I recently moved house and needed a new home security system. After researching options like Yale, SimpliSafe, etc., I found that a cheaper, more installer-focused system was suitable for my needs. I settled on the Visonic Powermaster GTX Compact.

Purchased from: [https://alertelectrical.com/visonic-powermaster-gtx-compact-wireless-alarm-system.html](https://alertelectrical.com/visonic-powermaster-gtx-compact-wireless-alarm-system.html)

If you're looking for a easy to setup home security system, this isn't for you. This is a system that requires a bit of technical knowledge to get going.

# What's in the box?
* Visonic PowerMaster-GTX Compact Wireless Alarm Panel x 1
* Visonic PG2 PowerMaster MP-802 Pet Tolerant Wireless PIR (0-103432) x 3
* Visonic PG2 PowerMaster MC-303V Wireless Micro Door Contact (0-102923) x 1
* Visonic PG2 PowerMaster KF-235 Wireless Keyfob (0-102202) x 2
* Visonic PowerMaster Wireless Two-Way Outdoor Siren 0-102998 x 1
* Manuals!

# What's not in the box?
* Power cable: I had to sacrafice a kettle lead to power the panel (120 -> 240v)
* IP/SMS Modules: To use the VisonicGo app or any SMS features, you need to purchase the IP/SMS modules separately

# Installation and Setup
The majority of the peripherals are wireless, which means mounting and pairing with the panel (many components come pre-linked). The panel setup is a tad trickier as you'll have to configure zones, operation modes, users, etc. All these configurations are done on the panel using the manual.

I spent about a day setting up the system. I had to peruse the manual multiple times to grasp the mechanics, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straightforward.

Most components can be affixed using the provided double-sided tape. The only piece requiring screws is the outdoor siren (wall plugs and screws included).

# Custom Work
* In the coming year, a friend and I plan to develop a backend service to avoid costs associated with the VisonicGo app.

# Final Opinion
If you want a plug-and-play solution, opt for a pricier, consumer-centric system. However, if customization is your thing, I highly recommend this system.
