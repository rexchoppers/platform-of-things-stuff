# Overview
I love numbers stations. There's something fascinating about the way they operate, the mystery behind their messages.

Example number stations:

- [Lincolnshire Poacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXz6ghbfd2U)
- [The Buzzer UVB-76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIAbtLmKoZE)
- [The Swedish Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXziS-GpPOo)

As a fun side project, I've delved into the world of cryptography and developed Station 3310.

# Message Format
The messages are structured as follows:

1. Jingle: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpeWHtlIsB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpeWHtlIsB4). This is the full song which the Nokia ringtone is based on hence the name "Station 3310"
2. 5 character "Mission ID": Repeated 5 times.
3. Howler signal: Indicates start of message
4. Message body: 10 groups of 5 digits. Repeated 5 times.
5. Howler signal: Indicates end of message
